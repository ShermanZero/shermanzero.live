Youâ€™re a very sweet person.  Thank you for giving me some soap, idk whether to be offended or not.  Iâ€™m jk lmao but you really donâ€™t have to give me anything.  No strings attached remember?  No expectation of you to give me anything at all in return for what Iâ€™ve given to you.  I give to you because I care about you and you probably do the same for me, but I just want to make sure in case not, that you donâ€™t feel like you need to because there are literally zero strings.



It was nice to see you this morning.  You seemed a tiny bit off over FT and in person so I hope youâ€™re okay.  I donâ€™t want to analyze it too much.  I used to analyze every single thing and search for deeper meaning but I donâ€™t much anymore.  If I started to analyze this morning I would undoubtedly get worried about our friendship and I donâ€™t need to add more stress to my life.  If I get a gut feeling or I notice something that strikes me as a little off, I just tell myself Iâ€™m wrong and ignore it most of the time.  At the same time I do want to make sure youâ€™re okay though, so Iâ€™ll definitely ask you, but also take what you tell me as face value because I canâ€™t do the social games with people anymore of trying to find something that may or may not be there.



Thank you for the house tour by the way :) youâ€™re really just welcoming me into your life with open arms and it makes me want to cry.  I donâ€™t really know how to feel or how to act but Iâ€™ll just keep telling you that I appreciate you and am happy my shitty life put me in this shitty state in this shitty town so I got to meet not shitty you.

I wanted to come back in tonight to see you and idk why but I had a feeling you could use some tea.  Maybe I was wrong but hey itâ€™s tea you canâ€™t be mad at tea.  I had a boring night.  Just counting the hours really until I can sleep and work in the morning.  I hope your shift went smoothly.  You make me so concerned about your hands ðŸ˜© take care of yourself Linzy!! ðŸ˜¡ god I wish I had a shitton of money because I would literally just pay you every day not to work until you recover.



Side note Iâ€™ve never really looked at your car much but now that Iâ€™m sitting next to it in mine, itâ€™s kinda sick.  Your gas cap is the tiniest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen lmfao.

I donâ€™t deserve you or the way you treat me.  Thank you for the owl Linzy I donâ€™t know how to tell you how much you mean to me.  You donâ€™t need to get me anything ever, but youâ€™re so kind and caring and thoughtful and sweet.  Thank you ðŸ’œ
